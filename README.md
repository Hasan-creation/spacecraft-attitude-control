## Installation

To get started with the **Spacecraft Attitude Control** simulation, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Hasan-creation/spacecraft-attitude-control.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd spacecraft-attitude-control
   ```

3. **Install Required Packages**:
   Ensure you have Python installed on your machine. Then, install the required packages using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install pygame numpy
   ```

4. **Run the Simulation**:
   After installation, you can run the simulation with:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Usage

Once the simulation is running, you will see a graphical interface where you can control the spacecraft's attitude. Use the keyboard or mouse to manipulate the spacecraft's orientation. The interface provides real-time feedback on the spacecraft's dynamics.

### Controls

- **Arrow Keys**: Rotate the spacecraft.
- **Mouse Movement**: Adjust the view angle.
- **Spacebar**: Reset the spacecraft to its initial position.

## How It Works

The core of the simulation relies on principles of 3D mathematics and control theory. 

### 3D Rotation

The simulation uses rotation matrices to manipulate the spacecraft's orientation. Each rotation is represented as a transformation in 3D space, allowing for realistic movement.

### PID Control

The PID controller adjusts the spacecraft's attitude by minimizing the error between the desired and actual orientation. The controller uses three parameters:

- **Proportional (P)**: Responds to the current error.
- **Integral (I)**: Addresses the accumulated error over time.
- **Derivative (D)**: Predicts future error based on its rate of change.

This combination provides a smooth and stable control response.

### Space Physics

The simulation incorporates basic physics laws governing motion in space. It simulates gravitational forces, inertia, and angular momentum, providing a realistic environment for users to explore.
